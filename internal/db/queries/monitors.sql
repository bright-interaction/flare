-- Overdue is measured from COALESCE(last_ping_at, created_at): a monitor that
-- has NEVER checked in is the most important case (the scheduled job never ran
-- at all), and the previous `last_ping_at IS NOT NULL` guard excluded exactly
-- that case, so a cron that never fired once was never alerted.
-- Already-missing monitors are re-listed once past the re-notify window so a
-- dropped delivery cannot permanently suppress a dead-cron page.
