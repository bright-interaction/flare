-- Org-wide dashboard aggregates for the Overview page. Every query is scoped
-- by org_id (the tenant boundary); they intentionally span all of the org's
-- projects, so each carries a ciguard allow-no-project marker directly above
-- its -- name: directive.
--
-- The Overview is the ACTIONABLE ops view, so every metric here excludes
-- info/debug-level signals (heartbeats, breadcrumbs, health check-ins): they
-- are informational, never incidents, and must not inflate counts, dominate Top
-- Issues, or ride the volume charts. They still exist (visible via the project
-- issue list with an explicit filter) and still count toward the watchdog's
-- silence detection, which reads events directly and is unaffected by this.

-- does NOT exclude info/debug: an info-level heartbeat ("service-up:<svc>") is
-- exactly what proves a service is alive when it has no errors, so it must count
-- here even though it is filtered out of every actionable count above. Bounded to
-- the last 7 days so the scan stays on recent partitions; a project with no row
-- has had no pulse in a week and is treated as silent.
