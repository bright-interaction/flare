-- Revoke every key a given user minted. Used by the password-reset path: a
-- reset must not leave behind a credential the attacker created while they had
-- the account. Keys with a NULL creator predate the column and are left alone
-- rather than guessed at.
-- The org_id predicate is redundant in principle (a user belongs to one org, so
-- their keys are already that org's) and explicit on purpose: ciguard refused
-- this query without it, correctly. A tenant-scoped table gets a tenant
-- predicate, and "it cannot happen" is how cross-tenant reads get written.
