-- Bounded by BYTES, not just by row count.
--
-- A row cap alone does not bound memory: maxArtifactBody allows a 30 MiB source
-- map, so LIMIT 1000 permits 30 GB in a single request. The cap has to be here
-- rather than in Go, because pgx materialises every row before the handler sees
-- one, so a Go-side budget would run after the allocation it is meant to
-- prevent.
--
-- The window function accumulates content size over the same ordering the LIMIT
-- uses, so this takes the newest maps until the budget is spent and then stops.
-- Symbolication already degrades gracefully when a map is absent: frames stay
-- minified rather than the request failing.
