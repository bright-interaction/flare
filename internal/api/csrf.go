// conditionalCSRF enforces CSRF on cookie-authenticated (browser) requests and
// skips it for pure Bearer API clients, which carry no ambient credential and
// are therefore immune to CSRF by construction.
//
// The exemption used to be "an Authorization header is present", full stop, and
// that is not the same question. requireAuth authenticates from the SESSION
// first and only falls through to the API key when there is no session, so the
// exemption decision and the authentication decision were made from two
// different inputs and never reconciled: `curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer x'`
// with a valid session cookie was CSRF-exempt AND session-authenticated. Junk
// in the header was enough; the value was never looked at.
//
// It was blocked twice over in practice (SameSite=Strict on the cookie, and a
// custom header forces a CORS preflight Flare answers with no
// Access-Control-Allow-Origin), which is exactly the problem: the CSRF layer
// was contributing nothing, and the whole defence rested on two controls one
// config change away, a proxy that relaxes SameSite or a future CORS middleware
// for a separate frontend origin.
//
// So the test is now "is there an ambient credential on this request", which is
// the thing CSRF is actually about. A session cookie means enforce, whatever
// else is present. This runs before requireAuth, so it reads the cookie rather
// than the resolved session: an API client that also sends a stale cookie gets
// CSRF enforced, which is over-enforcement against a client that does not
// exist.
