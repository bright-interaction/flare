// TestDestructiveRoutesAreAdminOnly keeps irreversible and credential routes out
// of reach of an API key.
//
// Giving keys their own role fixed the DEFAULT (new keys are read-only) and left
// these routes inside the member group, so a key minted for CI provisioning or
// source-map upload still carried DELETE /projects/{id}, which erases a project
// and all of its telemetry in one transaction, plus the ability to mint and
// revoke keys including its own successors.
//
// apiKeyRole clamps a key to viewer or member and refuses anything else, so
// admin is unreachable by any key. Moving these three routes there is what makes
// that clamp mean something.
//
// This is a source assertion because the property is about ROUTER SHAPE: which
// middleware group a line sits in. That is invisible to a handler-level test and
// is exactly the kind of thing that drifts back when someone adds a route next
// to a similar one.
