// maxEnvelopeItems (ingest_handlers.go) bounds the ITEMS in a Sentry envelope,
// and on the events path one item is one row, so events were covered by it.
// Every other pillar fans one item out to an unbounded number of rows: an OTLP
// export nests resource -> scope -> record, and a Sentry transaction item
// carries its whole span tree. The byte caps bound the payload; nothing bounded
// the rows.

// Measured against the real parsers and scaled to maxDecompressedBody, one 8 MiB
// body encodes 2,796,066 log rows or spans, or 559,191 metric points. The rate
// limiter charges per REQUEST at INGEST_RATE_PER_MIN (1200 by default) and the
// DSN public key ships in the browser bundle of every project, so that ratio was
// reachable with no account.
//
// 10000 sits above every producer that actually ships (the OTel collector's
// batch processor defaults to send_batch_size 8192; Sentry caps a transaction at
// 1000 spans; the native SDK path flushes far less) and roughly 280x under what
