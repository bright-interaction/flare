# Every check CI runs, in one script you can also run yourself:
#
#   bash scripts/ci.sh
#
# Run it before opening a pull request and CI will not tell you anything new.
#
# WHY THE LOGIC LIVES HERE AND NOT IN .github/workflows/ci.yml
#
# Two reasons, and the second is not obvious.
#
# 1. A contributor can run it. Checks that only exist inside a workflow file are
#    checks you cannot reproduce locally, so you discover them after pushing.
#
# 2. It keeps .github/workflows/ci.yml STABLE, which is what makes automated
#    publishing possible at all. This repository is a filtered mirror, published by
#    a CI job authenticated with a repository deploy key. GitHub does not allow a
#    deploy key (or an OAuth token without the `workflow` scope) to create or update
#    anything under .github/workflows/. So every time a CI step changed, the publish
#    was rejected at the final push, after every gate had already passed, with an
#    error that read like a mystery. With the steps in this script, changing a check
#    touches scripts/ci.sh (an ordinary file the deploy key may write) and the
#    workflow file stays untouched, so the publish goes through.
#
# The consequence to remember: editing .github/workflows/ci.yml is now a rare,
# deliberate act (an action version bump, a trigger change) that needs a push from a
# credential with the `workflow` scope. Editing THIS file needs nothing special.

# Goose applies migrations in numeric order and records each applied version in its own

#                      target database still lists that version as applied, so goose has
#                      nothing to compare against and the migration is simply skipped.
